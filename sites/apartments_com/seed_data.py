"""Seed data builder for the apartments.com mirror.

Deterministic synthesis of 400+ buildings across 20+ US metros, plus floor
plans, units, schools, POIs, reviews, neighborhood data, and renters-guide
articles. Driven by a stable md5-based hash so reseeding produces byte-
identical SQLite — this is required for the /reset/<site> invariant.

Each seed_*() function is idempotent at the function level: it early-returns
if its primary table is already populated. Per-row gates are insufficient
because even a no-op `db.session.commit()` bumps SQLite metadata.
