# speedo mirror — data & asset notice

Upstream: https://speedo.com/ (Speedo International Ltd / Pentland Group)

All product copy, catalog structure, prices, size tables, quiz flows,
athlete profiles, blog articles, FAQ entries and page content in this
mirror were captured from the public speedo.com storefront listed in
`provenance.json` on 2026-09-26 with browser-profile fetchers (see
`scripts_dev/` for the normalization applied to each harvest). They are
Speedo marketing material mirrored for offline benchmarking; the Speedo
name, logo and brand marks are used here only to keep the mirror visually
faithful to the upstream site.

The benchmark user accounts (alice/bob/carol/david @test.com), their
carts, wishlists, saved addresses, payment cards and order history
(SP100001–SP100007, tracking numbers, case references) are fictional
fixture data created for this benchmark environment, as are the guest
checkout records the benchmark tasks create at runtime.

Imagery in `static/images/` (7482 files: product gallery shots, page
heroes, athlete portraits, banners and the logo) is real speedo.com
media captured from the CDN URLs listed in `asset_inventory.json`
(`speedo.com/cdn/shop/...`). No placeholder or synthetic images are
shipped.

The size-guide tables in `size_guide_data.json` and the quiz copy in
`quiz_data.json` are transcriptions of the corresponding upstream pages
(see `provenance.json` for the exact sources).
