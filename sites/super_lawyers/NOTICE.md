## Data provenance

All content (directory taxonomy, lawyer profiles, firm profiles, top
lists, resource articles, Q&A answers, feature articles, static page
copy, imagery) was captured from the live superlawyers.com family of
sites and its CDNs on 2026-09-26 with a real Chromium via Playwright;
see scripts_dev/ for the capture pipeline and asset_inventory.json for
the per-file byte size, SHA-256 and https source URL of every shipped
image. The seed database is rebuilt deterministically from the tracked
source_data/ snapshots (PYTHONHASHSEED=0, no wall clock).

## Imagery

3,992 real upstream assets ship with the mirror: 3,528 lawyer photo
variants (full / card / top-list crops, including the feature-article
featured-lawyer photos), 401 firm office static-map captures, 32
Ask-a-Lawyer answering-attorney headshots, and the site art (hero,
legal-issue cards and icons, selection icons, the circled-headshot
placeholder icon the upstream CDN itself serves in the photo slot of
lawyers without a headshot, logo, favicon). No generated imagery is
used; every file's byte size, SHA-256 and source URL are registered in
asset_inventory.json.
